# Horizon.MvvmFramework
The MvvmFramework is a simple and lightweight framework supposed to speed-up the development of MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) applications as well as to reduce code of common operations such as change notifications.

The main component is build as a portable class library so it can be used "view" independently. The Wpf submodule of this framework contains WPF specific behaviors and extensions. This framework was extracted from a working productive application. It will be extendend if a code snippet is worth to be added and might be helpful for common use cases. This project is a private project written during leasure time, published in hopes that it will be useful for other projects too. Last but not least, feel free to extend the framework :)
